## Pilot Mating to determine optimal concetration of LBS-Erm

#### Determined:
| MJM | Strain | Erm Concentration |
------|--------|-------------------
1130  | MB11B1 | LBS-Erm100
1100 | ES114 | LBS-Erm5*
1125 | SR5   | LBS-Erm10

*was not determined using this general protocol

## Scale up mating spots and banking

### Day 0
- Inoculate donor strain MJM1431 into 3mL LB-Carb100-DAP(0.3mM). Let grow overnight at 37 °C. 
- Inoculate recipient strain 3mL LBS. Let grow overnight on rotator at 25 °C.

- Total number of inoculation tubes will depend on desired final colony number and estimated CFUs per plate. 

### Day 1
- Pour fresh LBS plates. 
- Pipet 3mL 1431 (2 x 1.5mL) at 1min x 8 rcf into each eppendorf tubes. 
- Pipet 3mL (2 x 1.5mL) of donor strain onto the 1431 pellets and centrifuge 1min x 8 rcf. 
- Resuspend pellets in 300uL LBS. 
- Pipet 10uL mating spots onto fresh LBS plates. Aim for as many mating spots as possible. 
- Let mating spots sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, then move to 25 °C overnight. 

- Pour LBS-Erm plates at determined concentration (see table). 

## Freeze mating spots
### Day 2
- Prepare 50mL Falcon tubes with 10mL LBS. 
- Swab 20 mating spots into each 50mL Falcon tube (for last few spots, swab them into a volume of LBS that is 500uL per mating spot).
- Pellet mating spot solution (500uL x n mating spots per plate) and resuspend in 500uL LBS. 
- Pipet 50uL of this onto an Erm selection plate and distribute with rolling beads. Let sit at 25C for 1-3 days. 
- Add 5mL glycerol to each 50mL falcon tube of 10mL LBS + cells. 
- Mix well, vortex. 
- Pipet 2mL into clean sterile red capped tubes and store in -80C. 
- Pipet remaining 13mL into clean sterile 15mL falcon tubes and store in -80C.
