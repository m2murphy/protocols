## Preferred conditions for selected recipient strains
MJM#     | Strain | Erythromycin concentration | Plate wetness
:-------:|:------:|----------------------------|-------------------------
MJM1130  | MB11B1 | LBS-Erm100                 |
MJM1100  | ES114  | LBS-Erm5                   | wet - use fresh plates 
MJM1125  | SR5    | LBS-Erm10                  |

If the recipient strain is not listed here, conduct the pilot mating below to optimize conditions.

## Pilot Mating to determine optimal conditions

The purpose of the pilot is to determine the best recovery & growth conditions for a particular strain using variants of the following: 
- Erythromycin concentration of selection plates 
- Fresh vs. Dry LBS plates for mating 
- Number of mating spots resuspended onto selection plates

*These may be determined in the same experiment, or in a stepwise function using the results of one to inform the next. If attempted during a single round, inoculate more than 3 ml of each strain on Day 0.* 

### Day 0: Inoculate
- Inoculate donor strain MJM1431 into 1 x 3 ml LB-Carb100-DAP(0.3 mM). Grow overnight at 37 °C. 
- Inoculate recipient strain into 1 x 3 ml LBS. Let grow overnight on rotator at 25 °C.

### Day 1: Mating 
- Pipet 3 ml MJM1431 (2 x 1.5 ml) for 1 min at 8,000 rcf into a clean, sterile eppendorf tube. 
- Pipet 3 ml (2 x 1.5 ml) of donor strain on top of the MJM1431 pellet and centrifuge 1 min at 8,000 rcf. For sticky strains, centrifuge for 1 min at 9,000 rcf.* 
- Resuspend pellet in 300 μl LBS. 
- Pipet 10 μl mating spots onto FRESH LBS plates, as well as onto DRY LBS plates. Keep track of which is which in order to determine which matings were more successful. 
- Leave at room temperature for 3 min to allow the spot to solidify slightly; then move to 25 °C overnight. 

- If determining the optimal concentration of erythromycin, pour LBS-Erm plates at varying concentrations of antibiotic. For example: 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 (μg/ml).

### Day 2: Selection plating 
- Re-suspend each mating spot in 500 μl LBS. If determining the optimal number of spots that can be suspended in the same 500 μl and plated with minimal background, resuspend 1, 2 or 3 mating spots in a single microfuge tube with 500 μl LBS. 
- Plate 50uL from each microfuge tube onto selection plates. 
- Let sit at 25C for 2 days, or at room temperature for 3 days (i.e, over a weekend). 

### Day 3: Count Plates
- Note any concentrations at which colonies look uneven/unhealthy.
- Count the CFUs on each plate.
- Use this to determine the optimal conditions for your matings and your strain in the large-scale library construction and banking.


## Scale up mating spots and bank the library

The purpose of using many independent mating spots is to ensure that even if a mutant exhibits a "jackpot" phenotype and takes over one spot, that it is only a small proportion of the total library. This also works better for *V. fischeri* than using larger mating spots.

### Day 0: Inoculate
- Inoculate donor strain MJM1431 into 3 ml LB-Carb100-DAP(0.3 mM). Grow overnight at 37 °C. 
- Inoculate recipient strain into 3 ml LBS. Grow overnight on rotator at 25 °C.

- Total number of inoculation tubes will depend on desired final colony number and estimated CFUs per plate. This group of cultures will consistute Round 1. The total number of rounds will also depend on desired final colony number. 
- Pour LBS plates and leave on bench overnight. If using MB11B1, pour LBS plates on Day 1.* 

### Day 1: Mating
- Pipet 3 ml MJM1431 (2 x 1.5 ml) at 1min x 8 rcf into eppendorf tubes. 
- Pipet 3mL (2 x 1.5mL) of donor strain onto the 1431 pellets and centrifuge 1min x 8 rcf. For sticky strains, centrifuge at 1min x 9rcf.* 
- Resuspend pellets in 300uL LBS. 
- Pipet 10uL mating spots onto fresh LBS plates. Aim for as many mating spots as possible. 
- Let mating spots sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, then move to 25 °C overnight. 

- Pour LBS-Erm plates at determined concentration depending on background strain (see table). 

### Day 2: Freeze mating spots
- Prepare 50mL Falcon tubes with 10mL LBS.   
- Swab 20 mating spots into each 50mL Falcon tube (for remaining mating spots that are not a multiple of 20, swab them into a volume of LBS that is 500uL per mating spot).
- Pellet mating spot solution (500uL x n mating spots per plate) and resuspend in 500uL LBS. 
- Add 50% volume glycerol to each 50mL falcon tube of LBS + cells. (For example, add 5mL 50% glycerol to a 10mL solution)
- Mix well by vortexing for 5-10 seconds.  
- Pipet 15mL into clean sterile 15mL falcon tubes and store in -80C.

#### Diagnostic plating (before freezing at -80C). 
- Pipet 300uL of 1 sample of mating spot solution + glycerol into clean, sterile eppendorf tube. Centrifuge at 9000rpm for 1 min. 
- Discard supernatant and resuspend in 200uL LBS. 
- Pipet 4 x 50mL onto LBS-Erm5 and distribute with rolling beads. Let sit at 25C for 1-3 days. 

*The protocol may be paused here, and repeated up until this point for multiple rounds of mating. Plating onto antibiotic selection plates (Day 3) must be done on the same day for all rounds of matings.* 

## Final Plating and Swabbing

### Day 3: Plate mating spots onto selection plates. 
- For each 15mL Falcon tube containing 15mL of mating spot solution, pipet 1.5mL into a clean, sterile eppendorf tube. 
- Centrifuge at 9000rpm for 1 minute. Discard supernatant. 
- Resuspend each pellet with 250uL LBS. 
- Plate 5 x 50uL onto LBS-Erm plates. Distribute with rolling beads. Pool any leftover solution and plate 50uL at a time onto a separate batch of LBS-Erm plates. 
- Let sit at 25C for 1-2 days. If completed on a Friday, plates can sit at room temperature until Monday. 


### Day 4: Swab colonies
- Count a representative number of plates and calculate the estimated total number of colonies. 
- Prepare 40mL chilled LBS in a 50mL Falcon tube and put on ice. 
- Begin to swab colonies from the plate and into the 50mL Falcon tube. 
- When all the colonies from all plates are swabbed, add 50% volume of glycerol into the 50mL Falcon tube. (For example, if there are 28mL in the 50mL Falcon tube, pipet 14mL 50% glycerol). Vortex to mix well. 
- Prepare an appropriate number of EMPTY red capped freezer tubes in order to accomodate 1.8mL library solution in each. (For example, if there are 42mL library solution + glycerol, prepare 24 red capped tubes, and mark the tube that has less than 1.8mL solution in it). 
- Label the cap of each tube with "Lib __" with the appropriate library number (For example, MB11B1-pMarVF1 = Lib 31" 
- Label the side of each tube with "Library __,   "*strain*-pMarVF1 Library", the date and your initials. 
- Store in a freezer box specific to the Library and store at -80C.
